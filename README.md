## Getting Started
To get this project up and running for development and testing you will need to
get gulp setup.

### Requires
- Node.js
- Ruby
- Sass >= v3.4
- gulp-cli (installed globally)

### Install
From the command line in the root project folder run:

```$ npm install```

This will install gulp locally with all the necessary modules.

### Running Dev Environment

```$ gulp```

This task compiles the Sass to CSS with source maps, auto-prefixes the CSS,
spins up a localhost server, and watches for changes to all files in the 'src'
folder. BrowserSync automatically opens the index.html page and refreshes the
site after any changes are saved.

### Building Production Code

```$ gulp build```

This task deletes the contents of the 'dist' folder, minifies the CSS and HTML,
and copies all production files to the clean 'dist' folder.
